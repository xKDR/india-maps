# india-maps

This repository stores xKDR's maps of India, adapted from https://github.com/datameet/maps in order to fit our own needs, and contain data about the CMIE CPHS's homogeneous regions as well.

The data is in the form of a shapefile (`.shp`), along with its supporting metadata.  You can read it with any shapefile reader.

In general, the data contains district boundaries, which have associated HR and state information, which indicates which of these higher-level boundaries they fall within.
